           The Company adopted SFAS No.16, ?Fixed Assets?. Fixed assets, except land, are initially recognized at acquisition cost. After initial measurement, fixed assets are measured using the cost model, carried at its cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Acquisition costs includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bring the assets to the location and condition necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Depreciation of an assets is commenced when the asset is available for use and calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements 4 years Office equipment 4 years Assets under finance lease 4 years Vehicles 5 years Repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the year in which they are incurred. Expenditures that extend the future life of assets or provide further economic benefits are capitalized and depreciated. The carrying amount of fixed assets are derecognized upon disposal or when there is no longer a future economic benefit expected from its use or disposal. When fixed assets are retired or disposed of, their carrying values and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the statement of financial position, and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current year statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income. When the carrying amount of fixed assets is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to its recoverable amount which is determined at the higher of net selling price or value in use. At the end of each year, residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

           Finance lease income, interest income and interest expense are recognized using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all fees and other costs paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, including transaction costs.

           Post-employment benefits, such as pensions, severance pay, service pay, and other benefits are provided in accordance with the Company?s regulations, Job Creation Law No. 11/2020 (the ?Cipta Kerja Law?, (UUCK)), and Government Regulation No. 35/2021. Since UUCK sets the formula for determining the minimum amount of benefits, in substance pension plans under UUCK represent defined benefit plans. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of one or more factors such as age, years of service or compensation. The Company recognizes a provision for post-employment benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 24 (Revised 2016), ?Employee Benefits?. This standard requires the Company to provide all employee benefits under formal and informal plans or agreements, under legislative requirements or through industry arrangements, including post-employment benefits, short-term and other long-term employee benefits, termination benefits and equity compensation benefits. The liability recognized in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the date of statement of financial position, together with adjustments for unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past service cost. The present value of defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Keuntungan dan kerugian aktuarial timbul dari penyesuaian pengalaman, perubahan asumsi aktuaria dan amandemen program pensiun. Ketika program imbalan berubah, bagian imbalan yang terkait dengan jasa masa lalu karyawan dibebankan atau dikreditkan segera ke laba rugi. Keuntungan atau kerugian aktuarial diakui sebagai pendapatan komprehensif lain pada periode terjadinya. Pada bulan April 2022, Dewan Standar Akuntansi Keuangan Ikatan Akuntan Indonesia ?DSAK IAI?) menerbitkan siaran pers atas persyaratan pengatribusian imbalan pada periode jasa sesuai PSAK 24: Imbalan Kerja yang diadopsi dari IAS 19 Employee Benefits. Siaran pers tersebut menyampaikan informasi bahwa pola fakta umum dari program pensiun berbasis undang-undang ketenagakerjaan yang berlaku di Indonesia saat ini memiliki pola fakta serupa dengan yang ditanggapi dan disimpulkan dalam IFRS Intepretation Committee ?IFRIC?) Agenda Decision Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service IAS 19). Perusahaan telah menerapkan siaran pers tersebut dan dengan demikian merubah kebijakan akuntansi terkait atribusi imbalan kerja pada periode jasa dari yang kebijakan yang diterapkan sebelumnya pada laporan keuangan Perusahan pada tanggal 31 Desember 2021 dan untuk tahun yang berakhir pada tanggal tersebut. Pada tahun-tahun sebelumnya, Perusahaan mengatribusikan imbalan berdasarkan formula imbalan program imbalan pasti berdasarkan masa kerja sejak tanggal pekerja memberikan jasa hingga usia pensiun. Mulai tahun 2022, berdasarkan siaran pers, Perusahaan telah mengubah kebijakan akuntansinya untuk mengatribusikan imbalan berdasarkan program tersebut, yaitu dari tanggal ketika jasa pekerja pertama kali menghasilkan imbalan dalam program sampai dengan tanggal ketika jasa pekerja selanjutnya tidak akan menghasilkan jumlah imbalan yang material dibawah program tersebut. Namun, perubahan tersebut tidak berdampak material terhadap laporan keuangan dan telah dibebankan pada periode berjalan.

           Derivative instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The method of recognizing the result of fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as cross currency interest rate and foreign exchange swap as part of its asset and liability management activities to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate. The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting when transactions meet the specified criteria for hedge accounting treatment. The Company records, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions. At the time of the hedging transaction and in subsequent periods, the Company also made the documentation includes identification of instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: i) There is ?an economic relationship? between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. ii) The effect of credit risk does not ?dominate the value changes? that result from that economic relationship. iii) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Company actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Company actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in equity under cash flow hedging reserves. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the periods in which the hedged item will affect net profit. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is charged in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The Company?s derivative receivables and derivative payables are included in this category.

           The Company applied SFAS No. 73 ?Leases? since January 1, 2020. SFAS No. 73 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. This standard introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease, and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for: ? Leases with a term of less or equal to 12 months and there is no call option; ? Leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 73 on the financial statements is described below. The date of initial application of SFAS No. 73 for the Company is January 1, 2020. The Company applied SFAS No. 73 using the modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative impact of the initial application of SFAS No. 73. a. Impact of the new definition of a lease The major change in the definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. SFAS No. 73 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the identified asset and lessee has the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This is, in contrast, to determine whether a contract contains a lease under SFAS No. 30 that focuses on the 'risks and rewards' concept. b. Impact on lessee accounting The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach to all leases, except for short-term leases and low-value asset leases. The Company recognized lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets that represent the right to use the underlying asset. The Company recognized lease liabilities at the amount of lease payments accrued to the end of the lease term which is discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. While, the right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs paid, restoration costs and lease payments on or before the start date of the lease, less lease incentives received. Right-of-use are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter period between the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. If the ownership of lease asset is transferred to the Company at the end of the lease term or the lease payments reflect the exercise of the purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the assets. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 48 ?Impairment of Assets?. At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of future lease payments that will be paid over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments (including substantially fixed payments), less lease incentive receivables, variable lease payments that depends on index or interest rate, and the expected amount to be paid in a residual value guarantee. Lease payments also include the reasonable exercise price for the purchase option if it is determined to be made by the Company and the payment of a penalty to terminate the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the lease termination option. Variable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or interest rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate at the inception date of the lease since the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined. After the inception date of the lease, the amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. Furthermore, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there are modifications, changes in the lease term, changes in lease payments, or changes in the valuation of the option to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases (with term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets, and elements of those leases, partially or entirely not applying the recognition principles stipulated by SFAS No. 73 will be treated the same as operating leases in SFAS No. 30. The Company will recognize the lease payments on a straight-line basis during the lease term on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. This expense is recorded under general and administrative expenses in profit or loss. The recording implementation of SFAS No. 73 is applied for all leases (except as stated earlier), as follows: a. Presents right-of-use assets as part of fixed assets and lease liabilities presented as part of other liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at the present value of the future lease payments; b. Records depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; and c. Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest (presented within operating activities) in the statement of cash flows.

           The Company uses 2 (two) bases for classifying financial assets, namely valuation of the business model and evaluation of contractual cash flows obtained solely from payment of principal and interest (SPPI). Valuation of the business model The business model is determined at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve certain business objectives. The evaluation of the business model is carried out by considering, but not limited to, the following: ? How the performance of the business model and financial assets held in the business model are evaluated and reported to the Company's key management personnel; ? What risks affect the performance of the business model (including financial assets held in the business model) and specifically how the financial assets are managed; ? How to evaluate the performance of managers of financial assets (for example, whether performance appraisals are based on the fair value of the assets being managed or the contractual cash flows obtained); and ? Expected frequency, value and time of sales. Evaluation of contractual cash flows obtained solely from payment of principal and interest (SPPI) For the purpose of this valuation, principal is defined as the fair value of financial assets at initial recognition. Interest is defined as compensation for the time value of money and credit risk in relation to the principal amount owed over a certain period of time and also the risk and standard borrowing costs, as well as profit margins. Evaluation of contractual cash flows obtained solely from payment of principal and interest (SPPI) (continued) An assessment of contractual cash flows obtained solely from principal and interest payments is made by considering contractual terms, including whether financial assets contain contractual terms that can change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. In assessing, the Company considers: ? Contingency events that will change the timing or amount of contractual cash flow; ? Leverage feature; ? Terms of advance payment and contractual extension; ? Requirements regarding limited claims for cash flows from specific assets; and ? Features that can change the time value of the money element. The Company classifies its financial assets according to the following categories at initial recognition: The Company classifies its financial assets according to the following categories at initial recognition: ? Financial assets measured at amortized cost; ? Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; ? Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. During the year and at the date of statement of financial position, the Company only has financial assets measured at amortized cost and hedging derivatives. Therefore, the accounting policies other than the classifications of financial assets measured at amortized cost and hedging derivatives are not disclosed. Financial assets measured at amortized cost Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if they meet the following conditions: ? financial assets are managed in a business model that aims to have financial assets in order to obtain contractual cash flow; and ? the contractual terms of the financial asset provide rights on a certain date for cash flow obtained solely from payment of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount owed. Financial assets carried at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs and administration income and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial assets carried at amortized cost consist of cash on hand and in banks, finance lease receivables, other receivables and other assets. Income from financial assets measured at amortized cost is included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and is reported as ?Finance lease income?. In the case of impairment, allowance for impairment losses is reported as a deduction from the carrying value of the financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as ?Provision for impairment losses?. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative assets are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the profit or loss. Recognition The Company uses settlement date accounting for regular way contracts when recording financial assets transactions. Impairment of financial assets At each reporting date, the Company measures the allowance of impairment losses on financial instruments over their lifetime expectancy, if the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If at the reporting date, the credit risk of the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the entity measures the allowance of impairment losses for the financial instrument in the amount of the expected 12-month loss. The aforementioned losses represent expected loan losses arising from financial instrument defaults that may occur 12 months after the reporting date. Furthermore, the Company classifies financial assets based on the evaluation results which reflects the level of the credit risk of financial assets, as follows: a) Stage 1 At the evaluation date for impairment, the credit risk for financial instruments is not increased significantly since initial recognition as evidenced by no overdue of more than 10 days. For this reason, the Company will measure the allowance for losses for the financial instrument in the amount of 12 months expected credit losses. The 12-month expected credit loss is part of the expected credit loss throughout its lifetime that represents an expected credit loss arising from a default on financial instruments that might occur 12 months after reporting date. b) Stage 2 At the evaluation date of impairment, credit risk on financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition, which can be proven by the overdue between 11 days and 30 days. For this reason, the Company will measure the allowance for losses for these financial instruments at the amount of expected credit losses over their lifetime. c) Stage 3 At the evaluation date of impairment, there is objective evidence that the financial instruments are impaired, which can be proven by being in overdue of more than 30 days or motor vehicle collaterals owned by customers have been submitted for settlement of their financing receivables. For this reason, the Company will measure the allowance for losses for these financial instruments at the amount of expected credit losses over their lifetime. The purpose of the impairment requirements is to recognize expected credit losses over the life of all financial instruments that have experienced a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since initial recognition - whether assessed individually or collectively - taking into account all reasonable and supported information, including estimated information future (forward-looking). The Company applies an impairment requirement for financial assets measured at amortized cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In some circumstances the Company does not have reasonable and supported information available without fees or excessive efforts to measure expected credit losses throughout the life of individual instruments. Expected credit losses for the entire lifetime are recognized collectively by considering comprehensive credit risk information. The comprehensive credit risk information must include not only arrears information but also all relevant credit information, including forward-looking macroeconomic information, to approach the outcome of recognizing expected credit losses over the life of when there is a SICR since initial recognition at the level of individual instruments. Allowance for impairment losses on impaired financial assets that was assessed individually is computed using discounted cash flows method. While allowance for impairment losses on impaired financial assets that was assessed collectively, the Company uses statistical method of the historical data such as the Probability of Defaults, time of recoveries, the amount of loss incurred (Loss Given Default), considering management?s judgment of current economic and financing conditions. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance for impairment losses. Such receivables are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Impairment charges relating to loans and receivables are classified into ?Allowance for impairment losses?. If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in the customer?s receivable rating), the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance for impairment losses account. The amount of the impairment reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Subsequent recoveries of receivables written-off are credited by adjusting the allowance for impairment losses account.

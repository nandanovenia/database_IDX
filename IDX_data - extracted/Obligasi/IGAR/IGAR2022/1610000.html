           The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of The Group and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Thus, the Group controls an investee, if and only if, the Group has all of the following: i) Power over the investee, that is existing rights that give the Group current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee; ii) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and iii) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. Generally, there is a presumption that majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: i) The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee; ii) Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and iii) The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired during the period/year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the Non-Controlling Interests (NCI), even if this results in the NCI having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group?s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. A change in the parent?s ownership interest in a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, NCI and other components of equity, while the difference is recognized in the profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.

           Group uses the cost model for the measurement of its fixed assets. Fixed assets, except land, after initial recognition, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Building and Improvements : 20 years Machineries, Installation and Equipments : 4-10 years Office Furnitures and Equipments : 4 years Vehicles : 4 years Land is stated at cost and is not depreciated. The economic life of right to cultivate, right to build and use rights, not depreciated, unless there is evidence that the extension of rights most likely can not be obtained. The cost of legal rights to the land when the land was first acquired is recognized as part of the cost of land assets, while the cost of the extension of the right to be recognized as deferred charges and amortized over the useful life of the acquired rights or economic life of the land, whichever is shorter. Construction in progress is presented under fixed assets and stated at cost. The accumulated cost of the assets constructed is transferred to the appropriated fixed asset account when the construction is completed and the asset is ready for its intended use. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to consolidated statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income as incurred. The Group evaluates its fixed assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its estimated recoverable amount, which is determined based upon higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their costs and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the current consolidated statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimated accounted for on a prospective basis.

           Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods and other related products are transferred to the customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements. Certain contracts with customers within the respective business segments give rise to variable considerations. The Group estimates the variable considerations such as right of return and price adjustments arising from quality claim, changes of commodity price and sales volume, using expected value developed based on historical experience or using most likely amount developed based on historical experience taking into account also current purchasing patterns. The management established estimation method that ensure inclusion of these variable consideration only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Meanwhile, the recognition is made when supporting documents have been received from customers or when it is probable price adjustments will be given. Trade receivables represent the Group?s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in Financial instruments section regarding initial recognition and subsequent measurement. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the contract. Expenses are recognized when they are incurred (accrual basis).

           Current Tax Income tax expense represents the sum of the corporate income tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. Tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Taxable income is different from profit as reported in the profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Amendments to taxation obligations are recorded when an assessment is received and if appealed, when the result of the appeal is determined. The underpayment/overpayment of income tax are recorded as part of "Current Tax" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Adjustments to tax obligations are recognized when an assessment letter is received or, if an objection submitted, when the result of the decision objection determined, or if appealed, when the result of the decision on appeal from tax court is determined. Current tax is recognized based on taxable income for the year which income determined in accordance with the current tax regulations. Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences between the financial and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the financial reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and accumulated tax losses that have not been utilized, if taxable income is likely to be available so that the temporary differences can be deducted and the unutilized tax losses can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets (if they meet the criteria) are recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, unless the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future to enable some or all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets to be realized. Deferred tax assets that have not been recognized previously are reviewed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to enable the deferred tax assets to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the assets are realized and liabilities are settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date. Changes in the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changes in tax rates are charged in the current year, except for transactions that were previously charged or credited directly to equity. Deferred tax relating to transactions recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, is recorded in other comprehensive income or equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legal right to off-set deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities pertain to the same entity.

           The Group provides provisions employee benefits liabilities in order to meet and cover the minimum benefits required to be paid to the qualified employees under Collective Labor Agreement and Job Creation Law No. 11/2020 (the ?Cipta Kerja Law?, (UUCK)). The said additional provisions are estimated using actuarial calculations using the ?Projected Unit Credit? method. Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss at the earlier between: i) the date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and ii) the date the Group recognizes related restructuring costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. The Group recognizes the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under ?Cost of Goods Sold?, ?Selling Expenses? and ?General and Administrative Expenses? as appropriate in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income: i) Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains or losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and ii) Net interest expense or income. In April 2022, the Institute of Indonesia Chartered Accountants? Accounting Standard Board ?DSAK IAI?) issued a press release regarding attribution of benefits to periods of service in accordance with PSAK 24: Imbalan Kerja which was adopted from IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The press release conveyed the information that the fact pattern of the pension program based on the Labor Law currently enacted in Indonesia is similar to those responded and concluded in the IFRS Interpretation Committee ?IFRIC?) Agenda Decision Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service IAS 19). The Group has adopted the said press release and accordingly changed its accounting policy regarding attribution of benefits to periods of service previously applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2021, and for the year then ended. In prior years, the Group attribute benefits under the defined benefit plan?s benefit formula to periods of service from the date when employees provide their services until their retirement age. Starting from April 2022, based on the press release, the Group change the policy for attributing benefits under the plan to the date when employee service first leads to benefits under the plan until the date when further employee service will lead to no material amount of further benefits under the plan. However, the impact is not material to the financial statements and charged to current period.

           The Group initially measures financial instruments at fair value, and assets and liabilities of the acquirees upon business combinations. It also measures certain recoverable amounts of the CGU using Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (?FVLCD?). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: - in the principal market for the asset or liability, or - in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: i) Level 1-Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ii) Level 2-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. iii) Level 3-Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

           The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). The Group also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

           Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite life is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. A summary of the policies applied to the Group?s intangible assets are as follows: Goodwill Useful life : Indefinite Amortization method : No amortization Acquired through : Business Combination Software Useful life : 4 years Amortization method : Straight-line Acquired through : Purchase

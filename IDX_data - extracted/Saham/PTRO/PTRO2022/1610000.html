           The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The consolidated statements of cash flows are prepared using the direct method with classifications of cash flows into operating, investing and financing activities. The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

           The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power over the investee; is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company?s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including (i) the size of the Company?s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holding of the other vote holders; (ii) potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties; (iii) rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and (iv) any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders? meetings. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expense of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the interim consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group?s accounting policies. All intra Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group?s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling stockholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests? proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree?s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests? share of subsequent changes in equity. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the noncontrolling interest. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and the non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. Changes in the Group?s ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group?s interest and the non-controlling interest are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interest in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/ permitted by applicable accounting standards). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under PSAK 71: Financial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.

           Calculation of loss allowance for trade accounts receivable When measuring ECL, the Group uses historical defaults rates for groupings of various customer segments that have similar credit risk characteristics, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic drivers and how these drivers will affect each others. Loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, taking into account cash flows from collateral and integral credit echancements. Probability of default constitutes a key input in measuring ECL. Probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon, the calculation of which includes historical data, assumptions and expectations of future conditions. The loss allowance for trade accounts receivable is disclosed in Note 6.

           Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is recognized so as to write-off the cost of assets less residual values using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: - 8 - 20 years for building and improvements - 4 - 12 years for plant, equipment and vehicles - 4 - 5 years for furniiture and fixtures Certain components of plant, equipment, and vehicles are depreciated using hourly utilization basis over their estimated operating life. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is stated at acquisition cost and is not depreciated. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to profit or loss as incurred. Other costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service an item of property, plant and equipment, are recognized as asset if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss. Construction in progress is stated at cost which includes borrowing costs during construction on debts incurred to finance the construction. Construction in progress is transferred to the respective property, plant and equipment account when completed and ready for use

           At reporting dates, the Group reviews the carrying amount of non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Estimated recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of the non-financial asset (cash generating unit) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

           As lessee The Group assess whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognize the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group use the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: ? Fixed lease payments (including insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; ? Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; ? The amount expected to be payable under residual value guarantees; ? The exercise price of purchase options, if it is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and ? Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: ? The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; ? The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used); or ? A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification. The Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. The rightof-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Whenever the Group incur an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, to the extent the costs are related to a right-of-useasset, the costs are included in the related rightof-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the rightof-use asset reflects that The Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-ofuse asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group applies PSAK 48 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of assets policy. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in the line ?Other operating expenses? in the consolidated statement ofprofit or loss and other comprehensive income. As a practical expedient, PSAK 73 Leases permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. For a contracts that contain a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. Sale and leaseback When the Group transfers an asset to another entity and leases that asset back, the Group accounts for the transfer contract and the lease, by first applying the requirements of PSAK 72 when a performance obligation is satisfied to determine whether the transfer of the asset is accounted for as a sale. If the transfer of asset satisfies the requirements of PSAK 72 to be accounted for as a sale, the transaction is accounted for as follows: ? The Group measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right-of-use assets retained by the Group. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred. If the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the fair value of the asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates, the Group makes the following adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value: ? Any below-market terms accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments; and ? Any above-market terms accounted for as additional financing provided by the lessor to the lessee. If the transfer of asset does not satisfy the requirements of PSAK 72 to be accounted for as a sale, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset and recognizes a financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.

           Interest income Interest income from a financial asset is recognized when is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset?s net carrying amount on initial recognition. Recognition of revenue contract with customer In determining revenue recognition, the Group perform the following transaction analysis: 1. Identify contracts with customers that meet all the following criteria: ? The parties to the contract have approved the contract, ? The Group can identify each party?s rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred, ? The Group can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred, ? The contract has commercial substance, and ? It is probable that the Group will collect the consideration in exchange for the goods or services to be transferred to the customers; 2. Identify performance obligations; 3. Determine the transaction price; 4. Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and 5. Recognize revenue. The Group recognize revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised goods or services to the customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Rendering of services The Group generates revenue from the provision of mining services, including contract mining, overburden removal, and coal haulage to the mining sector. The Group also generates revenue from providing logistics and support services to the oil and gas sector. The Group enters into short- and long-term service contracts with customers. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group enhances assets which the customers control or the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefit of the Group?s performance. Revenue from service contracts is therefore recognized over time based on the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period. The stage of completion may be determined based on methods that can reasonably measure the services performed. Depending on nature of the service contracts, the methods may include: a. Surveys of work performed; b. Value of work completed determined based on schedule of rates for each of the activities performed which identify value for the work performed and hence the value of the revenue to be recognized; c. Services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed; or d. The proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs. Revenue from construction contracts The Group enters into long-term construction contracts with customers. The performance obligation is usually the entire project, as provided for in the contract, given that the different services are highly interdependent, integrated, and are aimed at transferring the project to the customer as a whole, representing the combined output for which the customer has contracted. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group enhances assets which the customers control. Revenue from construction contracts is therefore recognized over time on a cost?to?cost input method, i.e. based on the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs. Management considers that this input method is an appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations for long-term construction contracts of the Group Where the outcome of a performance obligation cannot be reasonably measured, and the costs incurred in satisfying the performance obligation are expected to be recoverable, the revenue is recognized only to the extent of the costs incurred. When it is probable that the cost incurred in satisfying a performance obligation will exceed the contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized immediately. There is no significant financing component in construction contracts as the average credit term is below 1 year. The Group presents its contract balances, on a contract-by-contract basis, in a net contract asset or liability position, separately from its trade receivables. Contract assets and trade receivables are both rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Group has transferred to a customer; however, the classification depends on whether such right is only conditional on the passage of time (trade receivables) or if it is also conditional on something else (contract assets), such as the satisfaction of further performance obligations under the contract. A contract liability is the cumulative amount received and contractually receivable by the Group that exceeds the right to consideration resulting from the Group?s performance under a given contract. Expenses Expenses are recognized when incurred.

           The individual financial statements of each Group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in U.S. Dollar (US$), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the interim consolidated financial statements. In preparing the financial statements of each individual Group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity?s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. For the purpose of presenting these interim consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries, except PTKPI, are translated into U.S. Dollar using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed through acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognized in other comprehensive income.

           Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group?s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. A provision is recognized for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax professionals within the Group supported by previous experience in respect of such activities and in certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the interim consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that is probable that taxable profit will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of their assets and liabilities. The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Current and deferred tax are recognized as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized outside of profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognized outside of profit or loss, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities when there is an intention to settle its current tax assets and current tax liabilities on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

           Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

           Defined benefit plans The Group provides post employment benefits for its employees at least equivalent with the post employment benefits as stipulated in applicable Law. The cost of providing post-employment benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, is reflected immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected as a separate item under other comprehensive income in equity and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the defined benefit liability. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: - Service cost (including current service cost past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); - Interest expense; and - Remeasurement The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in profit or loss. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit in the Group?s defined benefit plans. A liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognizes any related restructuring costs. Other long-term benefits The cost of providing long-term benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method. Past service cost and actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately in profit or loss. The long-term employee benefits obligation recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position represents the present value of the long-term employee benefits obligation. Termination A liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognizes any related restructuring costs.

           Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value except for certain assets and liabilities that are measured in accordance with their relevant standards. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer?s previously held equity interest in the acquire (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after the reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer?s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period (which can not exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group?s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interests were disposed of. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amount recognized as of that date.

           Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group?s cash-generating units (or Group of cash-generating units) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. A cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

           Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Classification of financial assets Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortized cost: ? the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and ? the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): ? the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and ? the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. By default, all other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Despite the foregoing, the Group may make the following irrevocable election/designation at initial recognition of a financial asset: ? to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income if certain criteria are met; and ? to designate a debt investment that meets the amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. Amortized cost and effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition), the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition. For purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including expected credit losses, to the amortized cost of the debt instrument on initial recognition. The amortized cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. On the other hand, the gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortized cost and at FVTOCI. For financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Group recognizes interest income by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit risk of the financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired. Interest income is recognized in profit and loss. Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL, specifically: ? Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Group designate an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration arising from a business combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition. ? Debt instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet either the amortized cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on different bases. The Group have not designated any debt instruments as at FVTPL. Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value as at each reporting date, with any fair value gains or losses recognized in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the ?other gains and losses? line item. Foreign exchange gains and losses The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate as at each reporting date. Specifically: ? For financial assets measured at amortized cost that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the ?other gains and losses? line item; ? For debt instruments measured at FVTOCI that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences on the amortized cost of the debt instrument are recognized in profit or loss in the ?other gains and losses? line item. Other exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income in the investments revaluation reserve. ? For financial assets measured at FVTPL that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the ?other gains and losses? line item; and ? For equity instruments measured at FVTOCI, exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income in the investments revaluation reserve. Impairment of financial assets The Group recognized a loss allowance for expected credit losses (?ECL?) on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortized cost. No impairment loss is recognized for contract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group recognizes lifetime ECL for trade receivables, other receivables and contract assets. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on historical credit loss experience of the Group, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast directionof conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognized is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12 months ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Significant increase in credit risk In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group?s debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar organizations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group?s core operations. In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition: ? An actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument?s external (if available) or internal credit rating; ? Significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument, e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices for the debtor, or the length of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial asset has been less than its amortized cost; ? Existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor?s ability to meet its debt obligations; ? An actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor; ? Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; and ? An actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor?s ability to meet its debt obligations. Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise. Despite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if: a. The financial instrument has a low risk of default; b. The debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and c. Adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when the asset has external credit rating of ?investment grade? in accordance with the globally understood definition or if an external rating is not available, the asset has an internal rating of ?performing?. Performing means that the counterparty has a strong financial position and there is no past due amounts. The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due. Definition of default The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: ? when there is a breach of financial covenants by the debtor; or ? Information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the Group). Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. Credit-impaired financial assets A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events: ? significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower. ? a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event. ? the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower?s financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider. ? it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. ? the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties. ? the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses. Write-off policy The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case of trade receivables, when the amounts are over one years past due, whichever occurs sooner. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group?s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognized in profit or loss. Measurement and recognition of expected credit losses The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets? gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for financial guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with any additional amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend, The Group?s understanding of the specific future financing needs of the debtors, and other relevant forward-looking information. For financial assets, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expect to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level may not yet be available, the financial instruments are grouped on the following basis: ? nature of financial instruments (i.e. The Group?s trade and other receivables and amounts due from customers are each assessed as a separate group. Loans to related parties are assessed for expected credit losses on an individual basis); ? past-due status; ? nature, size and industry of debtors; ? external credit ratings where available. The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit risk characteristics. If the Group have measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 months ECL at the current reporting date. The Group recognize an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance. Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognize a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfer nor retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognize their retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, The Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset?s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a group entity are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ?at FVTPL? or ?at amortized cost? using the effective interest method. However, financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing involvement approach applies, and financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group, are measured in accordance with the specific accounting policies set out below. Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is 1) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination to which PSAK 22 applies, 2) held for trading or 3) it is designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: ? it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or ? on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that The Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or ? it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument. A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading or contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: ? such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or ? the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with The Group?s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about The Grouping is provided internally on that basis; or ? it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and PSAK 71 permits the entire combined contract to be designated as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost Financial liabilities that are not 1) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, 2) held-for-trading or 3) designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Foreign exchange gains and losses For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency and are measured at amortized cost as at each reporting date, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on the amortized cost of the instruments. These foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss for financial liabilities that are not part of a designated hedging relationship. For those which are designated as a hedging instrument for a hedge of foreign currency risk, foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity The fair value of financial liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial liabilities that are measured as at FVTPL, the foreign exchange component forms part of the fair value gains or losses and is recognized in profit or loss for financial liabilities that are not part of a designated hedging relationship. Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the financial liabilities are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss. When the Group exchanges with the existing lender one debt instrument into another one with the substantially different terms, such exchange is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, the Group accounts for substantial modification of terms of an existing liability or part of it as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new liability. It is assumed that the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective rate is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. If the modification is not substantial, the difference between: (1) the carrying amount of the liability before the modification; and (2) the present value of the cash flows after modification is recognized in profit or loss as the modification gain or loss within other gains and losses.
